# CropHarvest Mosaics

Looking at the impact of preprocessing (atmospheric corrections, cloud masking, mosaic temporal range) on model accuracy when trained on the cropharvest dataset.

CropHarvest is an open source remote sensing dataset for agriculture with benchmarks. It collects data from a variety of agricultural land use datasets and remote sensing products.

The dataset consists of **90,480** datapoints, of which **30,899** (34.2%) have multiclass labels. All other datapoints only have binary crop / non-crop labels.

**65,690** (73%) of these labels are paired with remote sensing and climatology data, specifically [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2), [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/), the [SRTM Digital Elevation Model](https://cgiarcsi.community/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1/) and [ERA 5 climatology data](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5).

21 datasets are aggregated into CropHarvest - these are documented [here](https://github.com/nasaharvest/cropharvest/blob/main/datasets.md).

More details about CropHarvest and the benchmarks are available in [this paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JtjzUXPEaCu).

### Installation

`cropharvest` can be pip installed by running `pip install cropharvest`

### Getting started
See the [`demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/nasaharvest/cropharvest/blob/main/demo.ipynb) notebook for an example on how to download the data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5533193) and train a random forest against this data.

For more examples of models trained against this dataset, see the [benchmarks](https://github.com/nasaharvest/cropharvest/blob/main/benchmarks).
